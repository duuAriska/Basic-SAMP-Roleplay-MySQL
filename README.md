This project provides a basic roleplay script for SA-MP, designed for beginners who want to learn how to create their own SA-MP roleplay server using MySQL.

## Features

## Notes
- This script was created to help beginners understand how MySQL works in SA-MP scripting. It’s not a full-fledged roleplay gamemode, but rather a foundation for building your own project.
- Future updates may include new features and improvements, though nothing is guaranteed. For those learning Pawn scripting, feel free to explore, modify, and expand upon the code however you like.
- Hopefully, this project serves as a solid starting point for SA-MP scripting and helps in developing your own roleplay server. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
